University of Helsinki: Computational Thinking, Programming and Social Science

## Context

### Learning goals

## Lecture 1

### Contents

* Operations
* Variables

### Pre-assignment

* Read sections 2.1 - 2.3 before the class
* Install R Studio or VS Code before

Recomemndation: The course covers both R and Python.
If you have not done programming before and work in mostly social science context, I recommend starting with R.
