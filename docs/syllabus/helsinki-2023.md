# Computational Thinking, Programming and Social Science, University of Helsinki, 2023

## Context

This is a course organised at the University of Helsinki for Master and PhD students in social sciences.
It has seven lectures, each lasting 3 hours.
The lectures include both lecturing and time allocated to work with exercises.

### Learning goals

By the end of the course students can

* produce high-level problem solving strategies for real-world social science problems
* use variables and list their potential role in problem solving
* use control structures to solve problems
* use data structures to help in more complex problem solving
* use software library documentation and use software libraries
understand the basic idea of computational complexity and the limits it sets to problem solving

At this course, we use the book Computational thinking and social science: combining programming, methodologies and fundamental concepts [available at the University of Helsinki library](https://helka.helsinki.fi/permalink/358UOH_INST/qatqfk/alma9934427732906253).
Students are expected to read assigned sections and chapters of it before classes and work on exercises from the book.

## Lecture 1

* Operations
* Variables

### Pre-assignment

* Read sections 2.1 - 2.3 before the class
* Install [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) before

Recomemndation: The course covers both R and Python.
If you have not done programming before and work in mostly social science context, I recommend starting with R.

## AI and chatbot policy

Can I get solutions from AI based assistant?

Please do not.
The concepts we cover are essential to think about programming and computational approaches, the exercises are a tool to develop these skills, but they are not the goal, they are a mean.
The competence development should not be outsourced to an external advice, such as ChatGPT.
After you master them, go ahead and use these modern tools, but before, you really need to train your brains.
